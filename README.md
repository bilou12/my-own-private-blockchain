## What problem will you solve implementing this private Blockchain application?
Your employer is trying to make a proof of concept on how a Blockchain application can be implemented in his company.

He is an astronomy fan and because of that he spends most of his free time searching stars in the sky, that's why he wants to create a test application that allows him and his friends to register stars, and track the ownership of each.
